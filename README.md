In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, the necessity for accessible and user-centric 
solutions for daily activities has become increasingly pronounced. This project responds to this 
imperative by introducing a sophisticated HTML calculator, engineered with contemporary web 
technologies such as Bootstrap and jQuery. Functioning as a versatile hub for fundamental arithmetic 
computations, the calculator is designed to offer users an intuitive and frictionless experience. By 
harnessing the capabilities of web development, the project endeavors to bolster the accessibility and 
utility of computational tools across various domains, catering to the diverse needs of modern users.
